      style="color:Black;" When i first met of you in thought you were a bad person, someone who is always mad| and
      someone distance himself from everyone but knowing you know makes it all different..Your voice i dont like it
      The way you talk i hate it Your personality personally i hate it aswell i hate everything about you so much that
      i love you more than i have ever loved someone in my years of living..When i tried to confess normally you told me
      'that's just a joke right?' You made me promise that i was joking but to be honest i wasnt joking at all i dont like
      what im feeling for you it's just so different and full of hatred then becomes to this thing called love I know you have 
      a lover and by the time im sending you this my feelings are probably over you, im only sending is to let you know that i
      loved you so much more than i love myself at this point, Ah and don't worry about me i can manage to forget about everything
      i dont wanna be in a relationship with you but please let me admire and love you on my on i wanna experience this thing 
      called adoration and admiration i'm probably known for having so many man but thats not me trust me im a fool when i REALLY 
      Falled inlove just by doing this for a confession is already making me a fool, but i will do anything for a smile on your 
      weird ass face haha im joking i love you so much </h1>
